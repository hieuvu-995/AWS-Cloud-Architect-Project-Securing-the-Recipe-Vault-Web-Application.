- Disable password login authentication.
- Disable the public IPv4 address for the EC2 application instance.
- Restrict SSH access to users with specific roles or utilize Session Manager.
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Enable server-side encryption for the S3 buckets.
- Restrict the instances profile role that can access the buckets.
- Split the existing policy, which grants all privileges on S3, into two separate policies with limited privileges on specific buckets.
